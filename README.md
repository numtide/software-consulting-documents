# Software Consulting Legal Documents

**DISCLAIMER**: These documents have been designed for UK Law. Please seek
legal advice before using them. These licenses are provided "as is", without
warranty of any kind, express or implied.

The goal, with these documents, is to establish a baseline for software
consulting, just like what the MIT license is for software license. So that
companies who see these can sign them and be confident that they don't have
undesirable or hidden clauses.

A secondary goal was to have all the variables in front of the document, and
signature at the very end. This is mainly to reduce the preparation overhead
and make sure that all the values are correct.

## Jurisdiction and Governing laws

These documents have been designed with the UK Law in mind. Each country has
variations on how their laws are constructed and interpreted. We have made
these documents as generic as possible and they *should* be valid in other
countries.

Please ask your lawyer and let us know if the documents require any changes.
